### About

This is a project to work around an API using Vue. I have tried to follow the star wars theme with
my font and background choices.

I have created a class to fetch data from the rest API and another one to store the data, so I could save time and bandwidth.

I also made an random character button, so you could try finding someone that you don't know!

I am using the google API to fetch characters photos, but I can only do 100 requests per day, so with that in mind, I added a default photo in case it reaches the request limit.

I was planning to make a fact page with some cool infos, like the tallest character or the one that has more starships. Maybe in a future update I will add that.
